# Codex Skills — Yeon Routing Catalog

이 디렉터리는 Codex가 **필요할 때만 세부 절차를 읽기 위한 선택적 지식 모듈**이다. `AGENTS.md`는 baseline/override만 유지하고, 낮은 빈도 세부 지식은 여기에서 로드한다.

<skill_catalog_policy>

- Direct child directories under `.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` are reserved for active OMX runtime/control skills.
- User-authored, project, imported, or legacy OMC helper skills live under `.codex/skills/SHARED/<name>/SKILL.md`.
- `.claude/commands/*.md` 또는 `.claude/skills/*.md`가 source of truth인 사용자 제작 스킬은 `SHARED/` 아래 thin wrapper로 유지한다.
- SHARED imported skills preserve upstream procedures, but Yeon `AGENTS.md` main-only policy wins on conflict.
- `.codex/skills-archive/`는 Codex 기본 skill discovery에서 빼기 위한 보관소다. AI가 자동으로 읽을 문서가 아니라, 필요할 때 사람이 다시 살리거나 참고하기 위한 parked 자료다.

## Routing first: which skill should an AI read?

### 1. Core execution workflows

Use only when the user explicitly asks for persistent or autonomous workflow behavior.

- `ralph` — persist until verified complete.
- `autopilot` — full autonomous execution pipeline.
- `team` / `ultrawork` — coordinated parallel execution.
- `ralplan` / `plan` / `deep-interview` — requirements and consensus planning.
- `cancel` — exit active workflow state.

### 2. Yeon repo-local knowledge

Use for normal Yeon development.

- `yeon-project-context` — product, architecture, implementation, DB, UI, validation details.
- `git-pr-workflow` — main-only branch/PR policy.
- `ship` — main-only PR merge flow.
- `deploy-all` — main-only production deployment.
- `validate` / `verify` — verification pipeline.
- `nextjs-patterns`, `expo-patterns`, `monorepo-patterns`, `component-patterns` — framework/boundary details.
- `service-context-*` — service-specific design/function/routing context for `omx team` lane kickoff.

### 3. Review, cleanup, and quality

- `code-review` — structured critical/major/minor review.
- `ai-slop-cleaner` — regression-safe cleanup/deslop.
- `review-repo`, `bug-repo`, `refactor-repo` — repository-wide inspection.
- `self-improve-checklist`, `retrospective` — post-change learning and guardrails.

### 4. UI / product design

- `design-workflow`, `design-eye`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `frontend-design`.

### 5. OMC/Codex operations and tooling

- `setup`, `omc-setup`, `omc-doctor`, `mcp-setup`, `configure-notifications`, `hud`, `trace`, `debug`, `omc-reference`, `skill`, `skillify`, `learner`, `remember`, `wiki`, `session-insights`, `wrap`.

### 6. Specialized / experimental

- `ccg`, `sciomc`, `self-improve`, `external-context`, `deep-dive`, `project-session-manager`, `release`, `ultraqa`, `visual-verdict`.

### 7. Archived / not default-routed

- `.codex/skills-archive/writer-memory` — useful for fiction/writing projects, not default Yeon development routing.

## SHARED skills (non-OMX direct)

`SHARED/` contains every project/user/imported skill that is **not** part of the active OMX direct runtime surface. Some are generated from `.claude/commands` or `.claude/skills`; others are imported helper skills that should remain visually separate from OMX.

### Claude-SSOT mirrored SHARED skills

These are generated under `.codex/skills/SHARED/` from `.claude/commands` or `.claude/skills`. Do not edit their wrappers directly; edit the source and run `bin/sync-skills.sh`.

<!-- SYNC-SKILLS:LOCAL:BEGIN -->

- `ai-call-wrapper`
- `drizzle-migration-workflow`
- `frontend-structure-conventions`
- `guest-auth-branching`
- `make-3-agent-backlog-plan`
- `race-server-conventions`
- `route-state-contract`
- `tanstack-query-conventions`
- `zod-contract-conventions`

## OMX Direct Skills

Only active OMX runtime/control skills stay as direct children of `.codex/skills/`.

## Cleanup decisions

- `frontend-design-skill` was renamed to `frontend-design` to match its frontmatter name and make invocation predictable.
- Stray `.codex/skills/clarify.md` was removed; the discoverable wrapper is `.codex/skills/SHARED/clarify/SKILL.md`.
- User-authored wrappers were moved from `.codex/skills/<name>/` to `.codex/skills/SHARED/<name>/` so they are visually separate from OMX-provided skills.
- Non-OMX imported helpers were also moved to `.codex/skills/SHARED/<name>/`; only OMX runtime/control skills remain direct children.
- `writer-memory` was moved to `.codex/skills-archive/` because it is unrelated to Yeon's coding/product workflow and should not appear in default skill routing.
